I&#8217;ve often found myself, after watching a video on Vimeo, dragging the page up and down to reveal the additional video options available. I would then check the source and examine the inner workings and then travel over to google to see if I could find the name of this design pattern.

As of this writing, I have come up empty handed on a name for this pattern. If you know what to call it, I would love to know. As for pet names, Vimeo refers to theirs brozar, but I think I&#8217;ll call mine skinner.
