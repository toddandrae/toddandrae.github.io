I ran across a great article a few years ago that detailed [a solution to simple A/B testing](http://stevehanov.ca/blog/index.php?id=132). I wanted to build this in to a published site, but wasn&#8217;t sure I was ready to roll it test it on the masses. Luckily, I started working on our backend CRM and saw the perfect opportunity to include this. I knew I wanted to achieve a few key items:

  * Users&#8217; choices for layouts would be determined based on time on page compared to assumed needed time on page (too much or too little)
  * Choices would need a scale of similarity to prevent jarring view changes
  * A User&#8217;s choice should maintain priority the majority of the time and test small changes sparsely
  * Tests that failed constantly would need to be removed from the choices
  * Options would need factors to determine usefulness
  * Use cases would have to be classified in to groups
  * Outside factors &#8211; time of day/week, previous pages, amount of time on site, number of returns, factors
