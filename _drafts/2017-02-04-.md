One of my favorite &#8220;effects&#8221; is the zoomable image detail displays you get on some sites. Not the product zoom interaction from Amazon, though. I find that one to be frustrating andÂ obstructive. I haven&#8217;t toyed with the idea much recently since bandwidth has increased exponentially and display resolutions have also increased. I also wanted to look at creating the images as a web component.

Let&#8217;s start by getting our workspace ready. Create a directory. Run npm init. Create files.

I am going to use handlebars.
