I&#8217;ve been kicking this idea around for a little while and finally decided it was time to act on it (as opposed to the 83 other post drafts I have sitting around). If you started from HTTP v0.9 and the original HTML specification draft and modified your code along with incoming advancements, what could/should/would your code look like?

I have been working with HTML for 20 years and I forget at times where we have come from or the limitations we once had. I set out to create an application from scratch using what I know now applied in stages to the tech available as it came about. The first part of any application (or system) should be security, so, with that, I intend to start with a login system.

Hard to believe, but we can&#8217;t do anything with forms or inputs until sometime around 1997 (https://www.w3.org/Press/HTML4).Â For, roughly, one year prior to that authentication might have been handled by HTTP basic authentication which was first addressed in the HTTP 1.0 spec (https://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/1.0/spec.html). This spec also brought with it 2 new HTTP verbs, HEAD and POST.
