1 pixel image that refreshes every second is only the start. GetUserMedia and Navigator.GeoLocation matter. Heatmaps, Eye Tracking, Mouse Position,  Aborted Actions, Canceled Form Fields. GA, Clicky, MixPanel, HTML to Canvas

I wanted to be able to watch a user&#8217;s path through the site to see how they were using the app. This meant collecting keystrokes, mouse clicks, scrolls, mouse position, idle times, location, everything.  I also wanted to be able to group users into categories such as power user, casual user, frustrated user, etc.

The parts needed would be a web service that would accept posts or gets, a database to store the massive amounts of data, a client to transmit the information and a view to display the information.

I started with the client so I could see the data that I was collecting and plan the web service and database accordingly. Javascript file and a JSON &#8220;recording&#8221;.
