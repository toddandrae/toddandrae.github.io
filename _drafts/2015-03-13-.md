Let&#8217;s say you had an offline website on a laptop that couldn&#8217;t access the internets but you need to sync some updates. Let&#8217;s say you had a phone but tethering wasn&#8217;t an option because that would be too much temptation to browse imgur and destroy your bandwidth. Let&#8217;s say you also had a 2 3.5mm audio cable and two 3.5mm splitters (something I am sure everyone keeps stowed in their laptop bag).
