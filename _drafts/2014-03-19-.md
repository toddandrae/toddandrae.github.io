I attend a [monthly hackathon](http://firstfridayhackathon.com/groups/columbusga/) and rarely come prepared with an idea to work on (or at least one that doesn&#8217;t require more time than is available). That was until I was recently reading through some old tweets and ran across a quick idea that I never attempted.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550">
  <p>
    Prove you're not a robot? Getusermedia() captcha!! Wave at the camera. Stick your tongue out. Way easier than typing! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ideafortonight?src=hash">#ideafortonight</a>
  </p>

I made a note that this was going to be my subject and tried not to solve the problem until the first friday of the month.
